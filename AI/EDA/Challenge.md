## Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to extract the information enfolded in the data
and summarize its main characteristics . It is considered to be a crucial step in any data science
project since it allows us to uncover patterns and insights within our data. The expected output of
this challenge is a well presented notebook that illustrates the Exploratory Data Analysis applied
to the given dataset.
